## Overview :

The idea is to build a simple DIY egg hatching car. The car is constructed with plastic container so you can place your phone inside and it will drive hatching eggs for you instead. 

The car has obstacle avoidance feature , thanks to the ultrasonic sensors placed around the car. Since the game has different types of eggs (3km, 5km, 10km) the car also includes adjustment settings to accommodate different distances.
